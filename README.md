#### Smart Tracking Pancreatitis Device


##### This project aims to use multiple sensors to track the situation of pancreatitis and prevent future occurrence. I chose MAX30100, Hamamatsu G11193-10R, and a OLED screen display to measure the heart rate, blood sugar, pulse oximetry, and finally display on the screen to notify users.
